# Face Recognition using Python, OpenCV, and face_recognition

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform face recognition using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library. Face recognition is a popular computer vision task that involves identifying and verifying faces in images.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before running the code:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- face_recognition (`pip install face_recognition`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasanna-ezhilmurugan/face-recognition-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd face-recognition-system
   ```

3. Run the `face_recognition.ipynb` script:

   ```bash
   python face_recognition.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- Add images of the faces you want to recognize in the `images` folder.
- Make sure each image has only one face.
- Run the `face_recognition.ipynb` script.

The script will identify and mark the recognized faces in the input images.

## Configuration

- You can customize the `tolerance` parameter in the `face_recognition.ipynb` script to adjust the face recognition sensitivity.
- Explore the `images` folder for adding or removing images of faces for recognition.
